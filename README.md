===========

In-progress project to build the easiest golang framework using existing fastest components.

This project will be a starting point to develop a new golang based framework, initially, with my little to none experience using golang.
As I learn golang I will try to create such framework with the intention that people with node.js, php, etc.. backend experience will have no learning curve using that framework (maybe too much ambitious, but who says it is impossible?).

I will try to avoid, as much as possible, exposing "rare" stuff (pointers, etc...) when developing using this framework, trying to use the same conventions as a node app does.
